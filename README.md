## About the project
The game has a board which is stored as a 6x7 matrix. We toggle between players after every move. The user has to enter the column where he/she wants to place the coin. We make the move after checking if the column is within bounds and if it is not full, and then update the value of the board with the inserted coin. Next, the computer player (AI) has to find the best move among all the possible moves.
